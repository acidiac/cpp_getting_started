    The way arrays are implemented in C++ is inherited
    the name of an array is equivalent to a pointer to the arrayâ€™s initial element and vice versa. In the example below, 
    c is an array of characters, and p and q are pointers to the first element of c. They all behave essentially the same!

        the way arrays are implemented under the hood make for some interesting outcomes. We cannot compare 2 arrays
        as we can do with other variables.

        int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5}; and int b[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        (a==b) will evaluate to false or you will see the warning message 
        warning: array comparison always evaluates to false (-Wtautological-compare)

        this is happening because when we compare arrays what is compared is whether they have the same memory location
        in essence &a == &b, which is obviously not the case.
