Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm.
Best case time complexity is O(n) when the list is already sorted.
Average and Worst case complexity is O(n*n). So it is not recommended for large input sets.
Bubble sort involves these simple steps.
Compare adjacent items and swap them if they are not in the correct order.
Perform the above step until no exchanges are required,
