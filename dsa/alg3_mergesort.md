Merge Sort  is a divide and conquer algorithm.
In the best/ average/ worst case it gives a time complexity of O(n log n).
Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:
If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise:
Divide the unsorted list into two sublists of about half the size.
Sort each sublist recursively by re-applying the merge sort.
Merge the two sublists back into one sorted list.
