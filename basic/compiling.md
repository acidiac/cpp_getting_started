There are numerous copilers for c and c++, such as GCC, CLANG, Intel, HP, TurboC, BORLAND C++ so on. For all the codes in the section I have used GCC version 4.2.1 on mac. Although, it's not going to be a big deal for now, you can find out your gcc version version using:
> gcc --version

# Compiling with GCC

Let's say we had a cpp program called myprog.cpp. Using GCC we can compile it using command line or terminal using following command.

## Option1
 >g++ myprog.cpp 


* g++ : is the compiler we are using
* myprog.cpp: is the name of the file
